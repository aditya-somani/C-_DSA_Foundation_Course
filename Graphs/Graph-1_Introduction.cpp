 * Just have a basic knowledge of all these terminologies , just reading once will suffice.

-Graph - It is a non-linear data structure that comprises nodes.
 These nodes are connected to each other with the help of edges.

-Vertices/Nodes: This is a fundamental unit that represents an entity or object. Each node/vertex can be labeled or unlabeled.

-Edges: Edges are drawn or used to connect two nodes of the graph.

-Types of Graph

1.UnDirected Graph - are made up of edges with no direction they represent a two-way relationship between vertexes
 i.e. they can bbe traversed in both directions

2.Directed Graph - are made of edges with direction they represent one-way relationship
 i.e. they can be traversed in one direction only

3.Weighted Graph - each edge has a value associated with which we can also say as the cost or value of relationship between
 vertexes

4.UnWeighted Graph - No value associated with edges

-Graph Terminologies

1.Multi Graph - an undirected graph in which multiple edges are allowed between 2 nodes

2.Simple Graph - an undirected graph in which both multiple edges and loops are not allowed

3.Complete Graph - a complete graph is the one in which every node is DIRECTLY connected to every other node
-a direct edge exist for every possible vertex

4.Connected Graph - In this graph we have a Direct or Indirect path for every possible pair of vertex

5.Path - Path is a graph whose vertices can be arranged in a sequence

6.Cycle - Cycle is a graph whose vertices can be arranged in a cyclic sequence

7.DAG - Directed Acyclic Graph - a directed graph with no cycle

8.Degree - Degree of vertex ina graph is the total number of edges incident to it or away from it
 OutDegree - no. of edges going out from a vertex
 INDegree - no. of edges being incident on a vertex

-Now most IMPORTANT

-Trees - It is a connected graph with no cycles . If we remove all cycles from a graph we get a tree.

-Forest - if we remove an edge from a tree , it is no more remains  connected and should be called forest

-Facts related to graph

Tree -> |E| = |V|-1
Forest -> |E| = |V|-1 (max) -> worst case i.e. max
Connected -> |E| = |V|-1 (min) -> most basic example is tree and so it will have atelast min edges equal to that of a tree
UnDirected -> |E| = |v| combination 2 (max)
Directed -> |E| = |E| = |V|-(|V|-1) (max)
